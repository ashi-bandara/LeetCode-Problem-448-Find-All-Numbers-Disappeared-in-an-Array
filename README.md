# LeetCode Challenge D43

## Overview

Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository! This project addresses the coding challenge presented by [448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/). Below, you'll find details about the problem, my approach to solving it, and the implemented solution.

## Problem Statement
Given an array  `nums`  of  `n`  integers where  `nums[i]`  is in the range  `[1, n]`, return  _an array of all the integers in the range_  `[1, n]`  _that do not appear in_  `nums`.

**Example**
>**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
>
>**Output:** [5,6]

**Language Used**
> Java

**Difficulty**
> Easy

## Solution Overview
The solution first sorts the input array, which is important for the subsequent binary search operation. Sorting allows for efficient identification of missing numbers through a binary search, making the algorithm more time-efficient than linear search methods.

The subsequent loop iterates through the range from 1 to the length of the array. For each number in this range, it uses `Arrays.binarySearch` to check if the number exists in the sorted array. If the binary search indicates that the number is not present (`< 0`), it implies that the number is missing, and it is added to the result list.
